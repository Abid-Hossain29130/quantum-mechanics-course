# Temporary Hiatus: May-June 2025  

Between Week 1 and Week 2, documentation paused due to:  
- Eid al-Adha celebrations (national holiday in Bangladesh)  
- Medical emergency with 102Â°F fever requiring 2-week recovery  

**Resumed July 1, 2025 with stronger focus.**  

> *"The comeback is always stronger than the setback."*
