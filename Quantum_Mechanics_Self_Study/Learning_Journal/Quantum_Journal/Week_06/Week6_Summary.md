### Chapter 3 — Schrödinger Equation (Questions & Answers)

*Week 4,5 → Week 6 learning journal — questions I asked while studying Chapter 3 and the answers I found.*

**Short chapter summary (one paragraph)** :-

This week we focused on the Schrödinger equation and the wave function $\psi$. We studied time-dependent and time-independent forms, probability interpretation (Born rule), basic properties of $\psi$ (normalization, continuity, single-valuedness), free-particle plane-wave solutions, the probability current, and Ehrenfest’s theorem linking quantum expectation values to classical quantities.

## Key Questions & Answers

### 1. **What exactly *is* the Schrödinger equation? How is it analogous to Newton’s laws?**

**Answer:**
The (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation (TDSE) is the fundamental dynamical equation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. For a single particle,

$$
\hat H\Psi(\mathbf r,t)=i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf r,t),
$$

where 
$\hat H$ is the Hamiltonian operator (e.g. $-\tfrac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf r,t)$). 
It determines how the quantum state $\Psi$ evolves in time — analogous to Newton’s $F=ma$ which determines trajectories in classical mechanics. The TDSE is the quantum dynamical law; solutions encode all future probabilities for measurements. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])

### 2. **What is the wave function $\psi$? What is its “physical significance”?**

**Answer:**
$\psi(\mathbf r,t)$ is a complex amplitude whose squared modulus $|\psi(\mathbf r,t)|^2$ gives the probability density to find the particle at $\mathbf r$ at time $t$ (Born rule). The wave function itself is not directly observable; only probabilities and expectation values (constructed from $\psi$) correspond to measurable outcomes. The complex phase of $\psi$ carries information (interference, currents) that $|\psi|^2$ alone cannot. ([Wikipedia][2], [farside.ph.utexas.edu][3])

---

### 3. **Why didn’t Schrödinger’s original “smeared charge” idea work — why Born’s interpretation?**

**Answer:**
Schrödinger initially explored interpreting $|\psi|^2$ as a physical charge (or mass) density. The problem: that interpretation couldn’t account for discrete detection events and quantized outcomes in experiments (e.g., photoelectric counts, detector clicks). Born proposed the probabilistic interpretation (probability amplitude $\psi$, probability density $|\psi|^2$), which matched experiments: measurements give single outcomes sampled from a distribution $|\psi|^2$. Thus Born’s rule resolved the mismatch with observed discrete measurement statistics. ([Wikipedia][2])

---

### 4. **If the particle is “smeared out” by $|\psi|^2$, what do we actually measure? How do we get a single result?**

**Answer:**
In any single measurement, the apparatus records a definite value (e.g., a detector click at position $x_0$). Quantum mechanics predicts a probability distribution $|\psi(x)|^2$; repeated identical preparations produce a frequency distribution that approaches this probability. The transition from distribution to single result is the measurement postulate: measurement yields one eigenvalue with probability given by the Born rule. (Mechanisms of “collapse” are interpretational  decoherence explains appearance of collapse in many practical cases, but the Born rule is what you use for predictions.) ([Wikipedia][2])

---

### 5. **Why call $\psi$ an “amplitude”? What is “probability amplitude”?**

**Answer:**
“Amplitude” emphasizes that $\psi$ is a complex quantity whose modulus squared gives probability. The complex phase (argument of amplitude) produces interference effects; different amplitudes add (with phase) and give nontrivial $|\sum \psi|^2$. “Probability amplitude” is the precise term: $\psi$ is an amplitude whose squared modulus is a probability density. ([Wikipedia][2])

---

### 6. **What does the differential $d\tau$ in probability integrals represent?**

**Answer (concise):**
$d\tau$ denotes an infinitesimal volume element in configuration space: in 3D, $d\tau \equiv d^3r = dx\,dy\,dz$. Probability that the particle is in volume $V$ at time $t$ is $\displaystyle \int_V |\psi(\mathbf r,t)|^2\,d^3r$. (For 1D use $dx$.) ([farside.ph.utexas.edu][3])

---

### 7. **Why must the wave function be complex? Could it be real?**

**Answer (concise):**
A real $\psi$ is possible for specific stationary states (real eigenfunctions can exist), but in general the TDSE couples real and imaginary parts: evolution generated by $i\hbar\partial_t$ naturally uses complex numbers. Complex $\psi$ encodes both amplitude and phase; phase differences produce interference and currents. Using complex notation is mathematically natural and compact; physically, the presence of the imaginary unit in TDSE ties time evolution to complex structure. (See discussion on complex nature in QFT/QM literature.) ([Physics Stack Exchange][4], [MIT OpenCourseWare][1])

---

### 8. **Why $\psi^*\psi$ is real (not “cancelled out”)?**

**Answer (concise):**
If $\psi=a+ib$, then $\psi^* = a-ib$; so $\psi^*\psi = (a-ib)(a+ib)=a^2+b^2$, a real nonnegative number. Multiplying by the complex conjugate removes the phase, leaving a real positive density. That is why $|\psi|^2$ is a probability density. ([farside.ph.utexas.edu][3])

---

### 9. **Normalized to one — does $|\psi|^2=1$ everywhere?**

**Answer (concise):**
Normalization means the total probability to find the particle somewhere in all space is 1:

$$
\int_{\mathbb R^3} |\psi(\mathbf r,t)|^2\,d^3r = 1.
$$

It does **not** mean $|\psi|^2=1$ at every point. $|\psi|^2$ is generally a function of $\mathbf r$; normalization fixes the overall constant (or scale) of $\psi$. If $\psi$ evolves under a Hamiltonian that conserves probability (Hermitian), normalization is preserved in time. ([farside.ph.utexas.edu][3])

---

### 10. **Rules of a wave function (single-valued, continuous, “well-behaved”) — what exactly?**

**Answer (concise):**
Main conditions usually required for physically acceptable $\psi$:

* **Single-valued**: $\psi(\mathbf r)$ must have a unique value for each point $\mathbf r$. (Otherwise probability ambiguous.)
* **Square-integrable**: $\psi \in L^2$, i.e. $\int |\psi|^2 d\tau < \infty$ so normalization possible.
* **Continuous**: $\psi$ should be continuous (finite) so probability density is finite. For potentials that are finite, continuity of $\psi$ and its derivative (or appropriate piecewise conditions) follow from the Schrödinger equation.
* **Differentiability**: Because TDSE involves spatial derivatives, $\psi$ should have the required derivatives (usually up to second order) where the potential is finite.
* **“Well-behaved”** is informal; it means “satisfies the above mathematical/physical conditions.” ([Physics Stack Exchange][5], [farside.ph.utexas.edu][3])

**Exam note:** mention these conditions briefly and state why (e.g., to ensure finite probability and applicability of the differential equation).

### 11. **Free particle solution $\psi = A e^{i(kx-\omega t)}$: what does it represent? why ± signs?**

**Answer (concise):**
$\psi(x,t)=A e^{i(kx-\omega t)}$ is a plane-wave solution of the free-particle TDSE. It represents a momentum eigenstate with momentum $p=\hbar k$ and energy $E=\hbar\omega=\hbar^2 k^2/(2m)$. The sign of $kx\pm\omega t$ indicates direction of propagation: $kx-\omega t$ is a right-moving wave (phase constant moves right), while $kx+\omega t$ is left-moving. Plane waves are not normalizable over all space (they’re idealized momentum eigenstates); physical free-particle states are wave-packets built as superpositions of plane waves. ([Physics Stack Exchange][6], [MIT OpenCourseWare][1])

## Additional Questions (dated entries) — focused technical points & Ehrenfest

### A. **Time-independent Schrödinger equation (1D & 3D final forms)**

**Answer (concise):**

* **1D:** $-\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2m}\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2}\psi(x) + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)$.
* **3D:** $-\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi(\mathbf r) + V(\mathbf r)\psi(\mathbf r) = E\psi(\mathbf r)$.
  These are eigenvalue problems for the Hamiltonian $\hat H\psi = E\psi$. Use separation of variables for time-dependent problems to obtain stationary states. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])

---

### B. **Separation of variables — why differentiate time vs space?**

**Answer (concise):**
Separation assumes $\Psi(\mathbf r,t)=\phi(\mathbf r)T(t)$. Substitute into TDSE and divide by $\phi T$; you get one side purely time dependent and one side purely spatial. Since they equal for all $(\mathbf r,t)$, each side must equal a constant (the separation constant, usually labelled $E$). This yields ODEs: one for $T(t)$ (time derivative) and one for $\phi(\mathbf r)$ (spatial derivatives). That’s why we differentiate time part w\.r.t time and spatial part w\.r.t space — because each equation involves only that variable after separation. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])

---

### C. **Probability current density — how to calculate?**

**Answer (concise):**
The probability density is $\rho = |\psi|^2$. The probability current density (in absence of electromagnetic potentials) is

$$
\mathbf j = -\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left(\psi^* \nabla\psi - \psi\nabla\psi^*\right) = \frac{\hbar}{m}\operatorname{Im}(\psi^* \nabla\psi).
$$

It satisfies the continuity equation $\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot\mathbf j = 0$, expressing conservation of total probability. For 1D, 
$j = \dfrac{\hbar}{m}\operatorname{Im}(\psi^*\partial_x\psi)$ 
([Wikipedia][7])

### D. **Ehrenfest’s theorem — short, exam-friendly derivation and the “final” results**

**Goal:** show

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\langle x \rangle = \frac{\langle p \rangle}{m},\qquad
\frac{d}{dt}\langle p \rangle = -\langle V'(x)\rangle.
$$

**Concise derivation (exam-friendly):**

1. Start with definition $\langle A\rangle = \int \psi^* A \psi\,d\tau$.
2. Differentiate: $\dfrac{d}{dt}\langle A\rangle = \int \left(\partial_t\psi^* A\psi + \psi^* A \partial_t \psi + \psi^* \partial_t A \psi\right)d\tau$.
3. Insert TDSE for $\partial_t\psi$ and its complex conjugate for $\partial_t\psi^*$: $\partial_t\psi=(1/i\hbar)\hat H\psi$ and $\partial_t\psi^*=-(1/i\hbar)\psi^*\hat H$.
4. Use Hermiticity of $\hat H$ and algebra to get $\dfrac{d}{dt}\langle A\rangle = \dfrac{1}{i\hbar}\langle [A,\hat H]\rangle + \langle\partial_t A\rangle$. (This is the general Ehrenfest identity.) ([Wikipedia][8])

**Apply to $A=x$:**

* $[x,\hat H] = [x,\hat p^2/2m + V(x)] = [x,\hat p^2]/2m$ (since $x$ commutes with $V(x)$).
* Using $[x,p]=-i\hbar$, compute $[x,p^2]=2i\hbar p$. Then $\dfrac{d}{dt}\langle x\rangle = \dfrac{1}{i\hbar}\dfrac{1}{2m}\langle [x,p^2]\rangle = \dfrac{1}{2mi\hbar}(2i\hbar\langle p\rangle)=\dfrac{\langle p\rangle}{m}$.

**Apply to $A=p$:**

* $[p,\hat H] = [p,V(x)] = -i\hbar V'(x)$ (in 1D; using $[p,f(x)]=-i\hbar f'(x)$).
* So $\dfrac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle = \dfrac{1}{i\hbar}\langle [p,\hat H]\rangle = -\langle V'(x)\rangle$.
* That matches Newton’s law in expectation form (force = expectation of $-V'$). ([Wikipedia][8])

**Exam-strategy:** write the concise commutator route (steps above) — it’s short and clean. If full line-by-line is requested, expand the insertion of TDSE and integration by parts, but for exams the commutator method is accepted and efficient.

## Questions about long textbook steps (Gauss theorem, 3.25–3.27 etc.)

### 1. **Should I reproduce the long Gauss theorem proof in an exam?**

**Answer (practical exam strategy):**
No — in most exams you should **state** the vector identity or Gauss theorem step and show how you apply it (brief justification). Full derivations of standard vector identities are usually not required. Demonstrate you know which identity is used and how it simplifies the expression. If an examiner specifically asks for the proof, then provide it; otherwise write a short line: “using Gauss’ theorem / divergence theorem, we convert volume integral to surface integral … and continue. This saves time and shows understanding. ([Wikipedia][7])

---

### — Full derivation of the second part of Ehrenfest (if you want the long version)

**Answer (short plan):** substitute TDSE, use product rule, integrate by parts, identify surface terms vanish (if $\psi$ vanishes at infinity), evaluate commutator $[p,\hat H]$, conclude $\dfrac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle = -\langle V'(x)\rangle$. If you want the **full line-by-line** text for your notebook (long version for your GitHub), say “Write full Ehrenfest part 2” and I’ll produce it exactly stepwise.

## Boundary & continuity conditions — what you *must* know (concise guidance for a physicist)

* **Must know (short list):**

  1. $\psi(\mathbf r)$ is single-valued.
  2. $\psi(\mathbf r)$ is continuous everywhere where $V(\mathbf r)$ is finite.
  3. $\partial\psi/\partial n$ (normal derivative) must be continuous where $V$ is finite; if $V$ has delta or infinite discontinuities, use matching conditions (jump conditions).
  4. $\psi$ must be square-integrable so normalization is possible.
  5. If using plane waves, understand they are not normalizable; use wave packets or box normalization.

**Why (physical reason, short):** continuity of $\psi$ and its derivative (where potential finite) guarantees finite kinetic energy and ensures that probability density and current are well defined. Discontinuities produce infinite kinetic energy terms or undefined behavior. ([Physics Stack Exchange][5], [farside.ph.utexas.edu][3])

---

## Final exam strategy (short & practical)

* **Write concise, correct results first.** Present the final equation/statement, then 2–4 short lines of supporting algebra. Examiners reward clear logic and correct final answers.
* **Cite or state standard identities** you use (e.g., “using divergence theorem / integration by parts” is enough). Don’t rederive standard vector calculus identities in full unless explicitly asked.
* **If time is short**, give the commutator derivation for Ehrenfest — it’s compact and elegant. Provide more detailed steps only if marks allow.
* **For long textbook steps** (3.25–3.27 style): summarize their role: “showing surface terms vanish and converting volume integrals to flux form; acceptable to cite the vector identity and move on.”
