# Week_06 — In-depth study & question resolution (June 2025)

I spent three weeks thoroughly researching and resolving the core questions I had from Chapter 3 (Schrödinger Equation). During this time, I:

- Searched deeply across textbooks, lecture notes, and academic sources,
- Gradually improved my understanding and answered each question in detail,
- Prepared high-quality artifacts summarizing my results.

### What I produced:
- **Concept Q&A**: detailed answers and clarifications from my Chapter 3 questions — see../Week_05
 
Now uploading these as Week_06 artifacts to reflect the depth and rigor of that research period.
