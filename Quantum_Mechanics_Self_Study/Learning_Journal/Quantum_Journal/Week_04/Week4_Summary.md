# Week 4: July 14-20, 2025
## üöß Documentation Hiatus: Honours Examination Period

As reflected in my official exam schedule below, this week marks the intensive phase of my Honours' 3rd Year Incourse Examinations. Since exams began on July 10, my complete cognitive bandwidth has been redirected toward:

Rigorous revision cycles (6-8 hours/day)
Past paper solving drills
Conceptual consolidation for physics subfields
Collaborative study sessions

### üì¢ Official Notice
This journal is temporarily paused during my intensive **3rd Year Honours Examinations** in Physics. Regular documentation will resume in Week 5 (post-July 21).

### üìÖ Critical Exam Schedule
| Date       | Subjects                                  | Time          | Status       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Jul 10** | Quantum Mechanics-1 + Computer Fundamentals | 2:00-3:20 PM  | ‚úîÔ∏è Completed |
| **Jul 15** | Solid State-1 + Nuclear Physics-1 + Electronics-1 | 2:00-4:00 PM  | ‚úîÔ∏è Completed |
| **Jul 21** | Mathematical Physics + Atomic Physics     | 2:00-3:20 PM  | ‚è≥ Preparing |

üö¶ Forward Path
Post-exam resumption: Full project documentation resumes after July 21

Catch-up strategy:

Condensed Week 4+5 update in early August

Video logs compensating for text gaps

Resource preservation: All research notes/experimental data securely archived

"The flexibility to pause is the discipline to prioritize."
Back with renewed focus post-July 21!
