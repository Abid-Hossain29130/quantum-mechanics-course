Temporary Hiatus Announcement: Prioritizing University Exams
(Effective: July 19, 2025)

Hi everyone,
Documentation for the Quantum Journal project will be paused temporarily, starting today (July 19, 2025).

Why?
My university exams are now in their most intense phase (Incourse exams running through late July- They Would directly affect my final result.). Passing these is critical for my degree, and they demand 100% of my focus and time.

A Snapshot of My Current Routine (for context):
"My days are strictly packed: 6 AM starts for study blocks, back-to-back lectures, lab reports between classes, late-night revision past midnight, and repeat. This leaves zero bandwidth for deep, focused documentation work — it’s simply unsustainable right now."

Plan & Commitment:
Hiatus Period: Immediate — until exams conclude (~end of July).
Resume Target: Early August 2025 (exact date TBD post-exams).

My Promise: I will return with full updates. This project matters deeply to me!

Thank you for your patience and support while I tackle this academic marathon. Back soon!
