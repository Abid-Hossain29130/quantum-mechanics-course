# Quantum Mechanics Learning Journal – Week 3 Update (July 5–11, 2025)

## 📖 Summary of Progress

This week was dedicated mainly to exam preparation and assessment in Quantum Mechanics. My focus was on consolidating my understanding of the key topics from Chapters 1 and 2, including the physical basis of quantum mechanics, uncertainty principle, operator theory, and foundational postulates. I reviewed concepts, solved exercises, and organized notes for efficient revision.

## 📝 Exam Reflection

Yesterday, I sat for an in-course class test in Quantum Mechanics. I felt well-prepared and was able to answer all questions confidently. This exam was an important checkpoint, as the marks will contribute to my final grade. The structured revision from earlier weeks proved extremely helpful in tackling both conceptual and problem-solving questions.

## 💡 Insights & Next Steps

- This week reinforced the value of consistent, focused study—even during busy exam periods.
- I plan to review the test paper once results are available and note any areas for improvement.
- Moving forward, I will begin Chapter 3 and continue to build on my understanding of advanced quantum topics.
