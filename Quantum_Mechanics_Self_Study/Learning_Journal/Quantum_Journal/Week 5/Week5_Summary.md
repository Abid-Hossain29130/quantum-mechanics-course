So after my exam in my university , About which I previously told in a notice my exam was over in 21-07-2025.
Then I continued my Journey of understanding the fundamental theories in quantum mechanics through my textbook I started my chapter 3.
Today I completed my chapter 3 of ##Quantum mechanics my university textbook.
                                                      ------------------ The book is written by Professor S.M.Moksed Ali.
So Chapter 3 has covered These specific topics here is the list :

Chapter Three: Schrödinger's Wave Equation
 * Wave function
 * Physical signification of the wave function \psi
 * Development of the wave equation
 * Orthogonal, Normalized and orthonormal functions
 * Probability and probability current density
 * Expectation value of dynamical variables
 * Ehrenfest's theorem
 * Time-independent Schrödinger equation and solution: Steady state
 * Schrödinger's equation for free particle and its solution
 * Boundary and continuity condition of the wave function
 * Exercise (Few mathematical problems)
   
# Problems and questions: 
## Had a little problem at understanding the wave function first. Asked a couple of questions About this topic but with the help of Google and chat-gpt and Some other research Platforms finally I was able to Grasp a good understanding about the Schrödinger's Wave Function understand.
[Still have some question unanswered and looking forward the other physicist for the answer!]
