Today I completed my chapter 3 of ##Quantum mechanics my university textbook.
                                                      ------------------ The book is written by Professor S.M.Moksed Ali.
So Chapter 1 has covered These specific topics here is the list :

Chapter Three: Schrödinger's Wave Equation
 * Wave function
 * Physical signification of the wave function \psi
 * Development of the wave equation
 * Orthogonal, Normalized and orthonormal functions
 * Probability and probability current density
 * Expectation value of dynamical variables
 * Ehrenfest's theorem
 * Time-independent Schrödinger equation and solution: Steady state
 * Schrödinger's equation for free particle and its solution
 * Boundary and continuity condition of the wave function
 * Exercise (Few mathematical problems)
   
##Problems and questions: 
# Had a little problem at understanding the wave function first. Asked a couple of questions About this topic but with the help of Google and chat gpt and other some research Platforms and finally I was able to understand.
