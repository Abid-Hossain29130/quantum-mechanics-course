# Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers â€“ Self Study

This is my self-study journey through Stanford's *Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers* course (via Coursera).

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Wavefunctions, SchrÃ¶dinger Equation, Operators
- 1D Infinite Square Well, Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
- Applications to quantum tunneling and energy quantization

## ðŸ§ª Mini Projects
- Simulated wave packet evolution in Colab
- Plotted potential wells using Python
