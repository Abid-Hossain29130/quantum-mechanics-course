# Week 1 – Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers

🧠 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to wavefunctions
- Schrödinger equation in 1D
- Operators and measurements

📝 Summary:
This week introduced the fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics. I understood how wavefunctions encode the probability distribution of particles, and how physical observables like momentum and energy are represented by operators.

📌 Still reviewing: 
- Operator commutation
- Boundary conditions
