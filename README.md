# Quantum Mechanics Course â€“ Personal Learning Journal

Welcome! This repository is my personal learning journal as I self-study quantum mechanics and quantum computing.  
All materials are organized week by week, reflecting my real-time progress. Each weekâ€™s folder contains handwritten notes (as images), study reflections, and any code or computational experiments I complete.

**Author:** Abid Hossain  
**Goal:** To build advanced quantum mechanics and computational skills, targeting scholarships in Europe (especially DAAD) for MSc/PhD studies.
This repository serves as my academic learning journal, code/project archive, and skills portfolio. It documents my self-study progress in quantum mechanics, programming (Python, Qiskit), and related fields.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `Quantum_Mechanics_Self_Study/Learning_Journal/Week1/`
- `Quantum_Mechanics_Self_Study/Learning_Journal/Week2/`
- `Quantum_Mechanics_Self_Study/Learning_Journal/Week3/`
- etc.

**Each weekly folder may include:**
- Handwritten note images
- Study summaries and learning reflections
- Code files or Jupyter notebooks (when applicable)
- Links to primary resources (e.g., lecture videos, textbooks)

> There are no special top-level folders for code or imagesâ€”everything for a week is grouped together chronologically.

## Motivation & Scholarship Goals

I am passionate about contributing to quantum research and technology in Europe. My goal is to join a leading MSc or PhD program (such as those supported by DAAD) and collaborate internationally.  
This repo demonstrates my academic consistency, coding skills, and motivationâ€”qualities I will bring to any university.
